# Movie Success

For the final project in our Intro to Data Science class, we were given the task to take what we had learned throughout the semester and apply it to a topic of our choice.
This final project was aimed to be a tutorial where we would walk through all the different data gathering, data cleaning, and data regression techniques we used for the
reader to follow along.

A group of two other classmates and I decided to tackle movie success. The goal for us was to try and determine what key attributes, if any, most contributed to a movies'
success and to then use those features to try and predict how well a movie would potentially do. Some of the features we looked at included release month, genre, and ratings.
